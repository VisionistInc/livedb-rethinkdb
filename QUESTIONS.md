1. Is polling implemented in any way in LiveDB/ShareJS?
2. Are any complex queries actually used by LiveDB/ShareJS? I see a lot of queries being used that are not used by LiveDB. Example: map/reduce, aggregation
3. What kind of queries am I missing?
4. It seems the tests are very tightly coupled with mongo
