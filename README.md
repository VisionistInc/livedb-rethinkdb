# livedb-rethinkdb

RethinkDB database adapter for [livedb](https://github.com/share/livedb).

The moduleâ€™s api is identical to [livedb-mongo](https://github.com/share/livedb-mongo) and works in the same way.

snapshots are stored where you'd expect (the named table with
\_id=docname). operations are stored in `collection_ops`. if you have a
users collection, the operations are stored in `users_ops`. if you have a
document called `fred`, operations will be stored in documents called `fred
v0`, `fred v1`, `fred v2` and so on.

json document snapshots in livedb-rethinkdb are unwrapped so you can use reql
queries directly against json documents. (they just have some extra fields in
    the form of `_v` and `_type`). you should always use livedb to edit
documents - don't just edit them directly in rethinkdb. you'll get weird behaviour
if you do.

## Install

```
npm install livedb-rethinkdb
```

## Usage

livedb-rethhinkdb wraps [rethinkdbdash](). it
passes all the arguments straight to rethinkdbdash's constructor. `npm install
livedb-rethinkdb` then create your database wrapper using the same arguments you
would pass to rethinkdbdash:

```javascript
var livedbrethinkdb = require('livedb-rethinkdb');
// Pass your RethinkDB parameters
var r = livedbrethinkdb({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 28015,
  db: 'sharejs'
});

var livedb = require('livedb').client(livedbrethinkdb);
```

if you prefer, you can instead create a rethinkdbdash instance yourself and pass it to livedb-rethinkdb:
```javascript
var rethinkdbdash = require('rethinkdbdash');
var r = rethinkdbdash({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 28015,
  db: 'sharejs'
});

var livedbrethinkdb = require('livedb-rethinkdb');
var rethinkdb = livedbrethinkdb(r);
```
## Test

Run the tests using: 
```
npm test
```
